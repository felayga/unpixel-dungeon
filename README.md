Unpixel Dungeon
=======================

Fork of Shattered Pixel Dungeon, which is a fork of Pixel Dungeon, a traditional roguelike game with pixel-art graphics and simple interface.

The goal is to remove some of the "simple" and bridge the gap between Pixel Dungeon and Nethack in terms of how the game is played.

To build the game you will need the modified PD-classes library:
